You will not be dissapointed if you invest in us.<br><br>  First off - I appreciate everyone who takes time to review my listing.  Please let me say I believe I am a safe investment.  I make all my bill payments on time and have been trying to focus on chipping away at me debt and came across Lending Club.  I have tried to receive unsecure loans in the past to consolidate I have not been successful only because in my opinion, the banks are to concerned with housing loans and cannot take risks on unsecured loans.  Which is understandable. but impersonnal..  I am responsible and make all my payments as I mentioned above.  I have had a lot of unforseen expensed come my way and had to use credit cards.  I strongly believe if I can consolidate that I can eliminate my current debt and move closer to my dream of home ownership.  This cannot be possible until I payoff my current debt.  Thank you for you time and hopefully your investment.<br><br>   As the last day approaches for funding I really hope you will trust and invest in me.  I still have a large percentage remaining to be funded and appreciate your consideration.  Happy Holidays to everyone!<br>',\n",
