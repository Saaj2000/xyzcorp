I have been working with Standard Renewable Energy (SRE) for the last month in designing a system that should meet at least 80% of my electricity needs.  I hope to improve this to 100% with additional energy conservation.<br/>The retail value of the system is $70,703.38.  However, with Oncor's (my electricity distributer) rebate and SRE's own rebate, my final cost will be $26,995.38.  Half ($13,497.69) will be due upon signing of the contract, and half upon completion of the project.  Additionally, I will be eligible for a Federal Tax Credit of approximately $15,300 when I file my 2009 tax return.<br/>I am approaching the investors of Lending Club for this loan because I purchased this house only 17 months ago and have not built up enough equity to qualify for a large enough home-equity based loan product.<br/>I have been an Air Traffic Controller for over 19 years and currently work in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.  The large monthly payments will not be a problem due to my rock-solid job, good salary and frugal living habits.  In addition, the solar panel array will lower, and in some months eliminate, my electricity bill.<br/>My revolving credit balance is high due to owning and maintaining two houses for 16 months.  I was unable to sell my former residence quickly because of the current economic climate.  However, I did sell it last month and would like to begin investing in my new home.  Please let me know what other questions I can answer.<br/>\",\n",

While I have credit cards, I do not carry a balance and pay them in full every month. My credit line balance is a line of credit with Bank of America. I used the credit line to remodel the bathroom and kitchen in my home to use energy efficient appliances with less electric and water use. The interest rate on the line is so low that I am not in a hurry to pay it off at this time.

       " 'Last year, my brother and I started our own business based in Columbia, MO with two key business units; one line of business provides raw materials for the second line of business.  The first business line is a residential/commercial tree, landscaping and lawn service.  The second line of business, sells the raw materials acquired by the first line; namely wood fuel, mulch, firewood and also accepts green waste from individual consumers as well as cities and municipalities.   You can visit our website at Braikbrothers.com to learn more about our company. We have been growing rapidly but, have found it difficult to access working capital by conventional measures so, decided to give this a try.   I have worked in financial services for the past 13 years.  I own a significant amount of residential and rural real estate with an average LTV of approximately 60%.  My largest real estate holding is 365acres in rural central MO.  The property is appraised at roughly $1.1MM (w/a $650k mortgage).  Most local lenders are not willing to increase the LTV on this loan with cash out above 65%.  My brother was the Controller/CFO of a family owned tree service in St. Louis for 6 years.  During this time he gained an enormous amount of practical, hands on experience into how a successful tree service should be run.  We have two certified arborists on staff.  One of which is eligible to sit for the Master Arborist certification which requires being a certified arborist for at least 6 years.  We have grown from 3 full-time employees when we officially began offering services in September of last year and given the demand for our services in Columbia and St. Louis, MO, currently employ 10 full-time employees.  With my brother heading up the day-to-day operations, a professional and well-trained staff to complete the work and my ability to provide personal capital and access to further financing I am very bullish on the prospects for our business.    As with any new business access to working capital is a key ingredient to success and I am excited by the opportunities this site may provide.  I can be contacted via email (jsbraik@yahoo.com) at any time should you require additional information.  ',\n",
       " \"My wife and I would like to invest in solar panels for our house.  We are purchasing a system that would provide enough power to cover 95% of our energy use.  The system cost is $38,483, but our final cost is only $8,613.  Our utility company pays 45% of the cost, but we still have to pay $21,293 up front to get the project started.  We will do this by combining the loan amount with the money we have saved.    The $12,680 difference between the up front and final costs is because we will receive this amount as a refund (tax credit) on our 2009 state and federal income taxes.  We will make a large one-time payment on the loan (in addition to the regular monthly payments) in February 2010 for this amount.  We are excited to invest in something that not only is good for the planet, but will pay for itself in six years by eliminating what we would've spent on utilities.\",\n",
